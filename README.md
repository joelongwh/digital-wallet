# Digital Wallet

## Motivation for the project
  Driven by mobile commerce, mobile wallets will become the most popular online payment method by 2024 globally, accounting for over a third of all payments in that time. In the U.S. alone, mobile wallets are predicted to overtake physical cards as the most popular online payment method in the next three years.
  If this trend continues, it is anticipated that digital wallets could make credit cards fully digital within the next decade. Interestingly, we already seeing merchants catch on to this trend, with online marketplaces scaling to an unprecedented level.
